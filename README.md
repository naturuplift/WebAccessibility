## Acceptance Criteria

- **Semantic HTML Elements:** Upon inspecting the source code, you'll find that we've incorporated semantic HTML elements to enhance structure and clarity.

- **Logical Structure:** The HTML elements have been organized logically, independent of styling and positioning, to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience.

- **Accessible Alt Attributes:** Image elements now include descriptive and accessible alt attributes, promoting a richer experience for all users.

- **Sequential Heading Attributes:** Heading attributes have been meticulously arranged in sequential order, optimizing the page's structure for both users and assistive technologies.

- **Concise Title Element:** The title element provides a concise and descriptive summary, contributing to a better understanding of the webpage's content.
